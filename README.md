## Weapon Detection

* Weapon Detection Deep Learning model built using YOLO (You Only Look Once Algorithm)
* This was only trained for guns at an extent.
* The model was trained using tiny-yolov2
* It was also converted to protobuf, yad2k and tflite formats.

All the weights can be found [here](https://github.com/Praneet9/Weapon_Detection/tree/master/weights)

### Used Library
[Darknet YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) 

Implementation can be found [here!](https://github.com/Praneet9/Weapon_Detection/blob/master/Weapon_Detection.ipynb)
